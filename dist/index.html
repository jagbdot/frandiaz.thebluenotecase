						<p class="content-description"><b>1. Culd you tell me a bit of yourself and your work life?</b><br>— 
I have been working in industrial marketing for 10 years. marketing for companies. Setting up an academy in the moment, an academy of marketing & strategies courses. I generally work with executives of industrial companies. So within my own strategy came the idea of ​​making my personal website.<br><br> <b>2. What is the reason to have a personal website?</b><br>— I want to level up my personal brand to the public and promote my own future online academy. So i'm looking for a clear way to explain those ideas as well as motivate myself to write a blog. Once the thing is built i'll feel the need to make it grow.<br><br><b>3. What do you expect as a result of getting the website? What is the goal in mind?</b><br>— I'd like to have a good impression in terms of design. Something clean. I'd like to write interesting articles in my personal blog. So the order would be as follows: 1. Clean design 2. Good content 3. Contact. I want to make it easy for people to get to talk to me and create a network of emails through <i>GetResponse</i> in order to reach them with interesting files and content.<br><br><b>4. Is there something alike currently online about you? And if so, what are the weaknesses?</b><br> — Yes, i build a website last year but it had many technical problems: First of all you couldn't translate the content for english speakers and the design was a bit off. After that i tried <i>Wix</i> but it didn't turn out ok. The marketing was not as i expected and the images didn't look good to me.<br><br><b>5. So who will be the right user for the website?</b><br> — I teach in <i>Universidad de Chile</i> and my students are interested on this. Also i'd like to reach executives of industrial companies working in marketing areas (marketing managers). I think those would be the two.<br><b>6. What do you think is good design for a website?</b><br> — Pictures in high resolution. No more than three colors in the palette, no more than two fonts. Simple and direct. The <i>call to actions</i> need to be highlighted.<br><br><b>7. What is the main value from the content you want to show?</b><br> — I want to give tips and tricks to develop your carreer in terms of marketing, strategy and finance. I believe in using your time effectively in order to save time in the future. The idea is not to sell but to help others and create value from that. The revenue comes along without thinking too much in the money. I also want to offer meetings, consultancies or personal training from one to one. Practical knowledge is a must for your mindset on any career. If that is in it's right place the rest will be alright.<br><br><b>8. How do you work with people? What is your plan of action once you get to know a client/student for a consultancy?</b><br> — Well, i think there's a certain behaviour on that. First of all we focus on what the problem is, then we simplify it and finally we elaborate a plan of action to go beyond and try to reduce as much as possible the levels of risk involved.<br><br><b>9. In relation to the blog, what are the topics of interest? Which kind of books do you read about normally? Could you name some of them?</b><br> — Fundamentally i tach about marketing, strategy and finance. I believe there's a virtuous circle on that realm. There's a logic behind it where i can play a role. About the books, i like <i>The four hour work week</i> from Tim Ferris, <i>The ego is the enemy</i>, from Ryan Holiday, <i>The subtle art of not giving a f*ck</i>, from Mark Manson and <i>Extreme ownership</i> from Jocko Willink. Those books helped me to incorporate some ideas into what i do, but of course we can't forget books like <i>This is marketing</i> from Seth Godin, which goes straight to the point on these subjects.</p>
